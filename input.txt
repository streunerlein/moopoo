every day we talk about fake news.
we browse the internet and get upset, sad because of hate speech, misogeny, racism, fake news
we browse the int, watch the news

we took this challenge and we defeated fake news.

maybe you think its fake news, but let me show you.
I was scrolling twitter and I got this post. I'm sorry, it hurt, 
but I'm gonna read it for you.

<show trump tweet>

that's a tweet from pres trump, he's free to express his mind, but I don't want to read it

using AI and machine learning from the google api
we defeated fake news.

that was before using MooPoo.

This is what I see when I surf now.
